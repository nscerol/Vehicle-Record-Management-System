# Overview
+ PHPGurukul Vehicle Record Management System is susceptible to a critical security vulnerability involving Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) through name, email and mobile parameter in the //admin/profile.php file. The application fails to adequately sanitize user-supplied data, allowing attackers to inject malicious scripts into the application. This could lead to the execution of arbitrary script code in the browsers of unsuspecting users, potentially compromising their security and privacy within the context of the affected site.

# Description
+ The parameters 'name, email and mobile' in the /admin/profile.php file of PHPGurukul Vehicle Record Management System V1.0 are susceptible to Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS). This vulnerability arises due to insufficient input validation and sanitation of user-supplied data. An attacker can exploit this weakness by injecting malicious scripts into these parameters, which, when stored on the server, may be executed when other users view the affected user's profile.
# Proof of Concept (PoC) : 
+ Go to the admin profile section
+ Click Update button
+ Intercept the POST request to /admin/profile.php via Burp Suite
+ Inject the payload to the vulnerable parameters
+ Payload: `"><svg/onload=alert(document.domain)>`
+ Example request for `name` parameter
```
